Exploring game of life inspired simulation.

This is the color map that will be used as the environment for entities on top. The color will decide if a particular entity dies or lives.

This color transition is obtained using bilinear interpolation: every cell is delimited by 4 points, a point has (x,y) coordinate and a value of temperature.

The equation used: `T(x,y) = a + b路x + c路y + d路x路y`
a,b,c,d are computed starting from the 4 cells point using A^-1 dot (t1, t2, t3, t4)

Where A is the matrix of coefficients for a,b,c,d rispectively, so for example first row is:
- point1: [1, x1, y1, x1 * y1]
